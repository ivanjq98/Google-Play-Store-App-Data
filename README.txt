*Dataset 1: Preprocessing and Machine Learning*
   This is split into 2 files: **Data Cleaning & Exploration** & **Machine Learning Model**
   
   In **Data Cleaning & Exploration**
   The following machine learning algorithms are implemented to clean Dataset 1:
   - Removing Null/Irrelevent Values
   - Removing Duplicates Apps
   - Corecting Datatypes
   - Data Integrity Verification

   In **Machine Learning Model**
   The following machine learning algorithms are implemented to analyze Dataset 1:
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
   - Decision Tree
   - XGBoost (Gradient Boost)

## Dataset Preparation

To execute the code, ensure you have access to the following datasets from Kaggle:
- `googleplaystore.csv`
- `googleplaystore_user_reviews.csv`

Ensure both datasets are in the same directory as the source code.
